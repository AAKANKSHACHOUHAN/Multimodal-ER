# Content Description 

"Notes" directory contains the report. 

"Experiment List" datasheet conatins a detailed list of all experiments carried out during initial hyperparameter tuning.

"SVM" directory contains all experiment files involving the SVM classifier and the individual datasets (RAVDESS, TESS, and CREMA-D). These are mainly Jupyter Notebook files from the inital work.

"MLP" directory contains all experiment files involving the MLP classifier and the individual datasets (RAVDESS, TESS, and CREMA-D). These are mainly Jupyter Notebook files from the inital work.

"Save_Features_CSVs" directory contains files used to extract features from the datasets and save them as CSV files for later use.

"Librosa_Results" directory contains all experiment files for the Custom feature set and both classifiers (SVM and MLP). This directory has two sub-directories. The "Confusion_Matrices" sub-directory contains experiment files for plotting the confusion matrices, and the "Results" sub-directory contains experiment files for printing the performance metrics.

"Best Models" directory contains the files of the best models. More specifically, it contains files of the best models created using feature set and both classifiers (SVM, MLP).
